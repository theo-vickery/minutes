## Committee Reports
- President's report - Andrew Gozzard
  - (Unplanned)
  - We had a really good year this year, we ran regular training sessions and contests
    - Once Max took over the ANZAC contests mid year, following the previous persons retirement
  - We hit over 100 members
    - 25 returning members this year, which is exceptional for a club this size
  - Still getting our sponsorship from Google
  - We've swapped our site to cloud hosting, which should be more reliable
  - Thanks to the rest of the committee for all their hard work
  - I hope we have at least as good or even better this year
- Vice Pres's report - Nick Pritchard
  - Continued structure for training sessions and competitions. We are now able to improve on past content
    - We have a solid bank of slides to keep working on
  - Excellent O-day with a lot of first-time members
  - We have a finals team 
    - 4 out of the last 5 years
  - We were involved with cross-club events this year (Charity Vigil) I hope we can continue
  - Big thanks to Gozz and Committee for dealing with me
- Treasurer's report - Mark Robson, delivered by Nick Pritchard
  - Hello all
  - I would like to 1st apologize for not being able to make the AGM in person and thank
<insert_you_name_here> for reading this on my behalf. Should you have any questions please call me on +61 481538725 or message me on slack.
  - To start off with I would like to report on the assets that we hold and how we have used them over the last year.
  - We currently have $1, 547.30 in out guild account and $ XXXX in petty cash
  - Which is roughly 2/3 from a google donation early last year at $990
  - And 1/3 membership
  - Moving to the negatives, out only ongoing cost is +-$35 a month for server hosting on digital ocean this amounts to $420 a year which is sustainable with membership should google stop its sponsorship. However, I encourage the next comity to watch this recurring cost.
  - I would like to close my report by thanking everyone for a great year and encouraging everyone to run for committee.
  - Final note call/ email/ slack message me anytime!

## Proposed Consitutional Amendments
- Gozz proposes the introduction of an Immediate Past President position to Committee
  - The IPP is a nonvoting position appointed by the executive decision of the President
  - Full changes are available to view online at https://github.com/uwapcs/constitution/pull/4
  - Preamble by Gozz:
    - Last year the committee gave a standing invitation to Max Ward, our immediate past president to attend committee meetings as if he were a regular nonvoting committee member
    - The propsed changes have the overall effect of adding the Immediate Past President Position to the committee
    - The new position would be non-voting, and optional
      - The new president, upon election, can decide if the IPP will be part of the committee
  - Discussion
    - James Myburgh: Why is this position optional?
      - Gozz: In some situations a club might have a terrible president elected one year, and the next year having that person remain on committee would be detrimental to the functioning of the club. This would give the new committee the option to have that person be not part of the committee
      - James Arcus: What benefits/powers does this give the IPP given that the committee meetings are open anyway?
      - Gozz: It would allow them to act on behalf of the committee as far as booking rooms and being part of the committee chat
   - Vote
     - Gozz moves to pass the motion
     - Tom Almeida Seconds
     - Vote passes unanimously
